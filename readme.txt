How to build:

1. If you have not already, install node.js from nodejs.org. This will install `npm` in your path.
2. Open console, and while being in the root of TsCodeFormatter project, run "npm install".
		This will install all the node dependencies.
		
3. Execute `%INETROOT%\src\uclient\build\TsCodeFormatter\build_and_test.cmd`
		This will transpile typescript into javascript, and will run unit tests on the existing 
		formatters.
